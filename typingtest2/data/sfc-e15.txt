Voyages of Dr. Dolittle
"I did not go to school; because my father was not rich enough to"
"send me. But I was extremely fond of animals. So I used to spend"
"my time collecting birds' eggs and butterflies, fishing in the"
"river, rambling through the countryside after blackberries and"
"mushrooms."
