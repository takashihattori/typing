Anne of Avonlea
"Diana hopped briskly down, tied the horse securely to"
"a post, turned the skirt of her pretty gingham dress over her"
"shoulders, mounted the fence, and started in pursuit of her"
"frantic friend. She could run faster than Anne, who was hampered"
"by her clinging and drenched skirt."
