Moon and Sixpence
"I confess that when first I made acquaintance with Charles"
"Strickland I never for a moment discerned that there was in him"
"anything out of the ordinary. Yet now few will be found to deny"
"his greatness. I do not speak of that greatness which is"
"achieved by the fortunate politician."
