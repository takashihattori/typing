The Gentle Grafter
"The next morning Bird City woke up and found itself an island."
"The river had busted through its old channel, and the town was"
"surrounded by roaring torrents. The rain was still raining, and"
"there was heavy clouds in the northwest that presaged about six"
"more mean annual rainfalls."
