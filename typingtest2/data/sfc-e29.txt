Anne of Green Gables
"Not a stray stick was to be seen, for Mrs. Rachel would"
"have seen it if there had been. Privately she was of the opinion"
"that Marilla swept that yard over as often as she swept"
"her house. One could have eaten a meal off the ground without"
"overbrimming the peck of dirt."
