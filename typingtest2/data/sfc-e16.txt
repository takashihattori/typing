Voyages of Dr. Dolittle 2
"We were now come beyond the edge of the town. And the house"
"that Matthew pointed out was quite a small one standing by"
"itself. There seemed to be a big garden around it; and this"
"garden was much higher than the road, so you had to go up"
"a flight of steps in the wall."
